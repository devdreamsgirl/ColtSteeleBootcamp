    <h2>Arrays exercise - just evaluate what the output would be without running code</h2>
    <pre>var numbers = [22, 67, 33, 96, 88];

    //what does the following line print?
  console.log(numbers[numbers.length])</pre>

<p>my answer - undefined. The console is logging the index of the array length.
The length is always one more than the index, so it will return undefined.</p>

  <h4>Correct!</h4>

<pre>var friendGroups = [
  ["Harry", "Ron", "Herminone"],
  ["Malfoy", "Crabbe", "Goyle"],
  ["Mooney", "Wormtail", "Prongs"]
  ];

//what is the result of this line?
console.log(friendGroups[2][0]);</pre>

<p>my answer - "Mooney". The console is logging the value at index[0] in the array indexed at 2. This is the first value in the last array.</p>

<h4>Correct! **These are called nested arrays or two dimentenial arrays.</h4>
