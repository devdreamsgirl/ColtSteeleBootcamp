    <p>Arrays are ways to hold groups of data together.</p>

    <p>Previously, we could hold information by placing them in variables:</p>
    <pre>
      var friend1 = "Charlie";
      var friend2 = "Liz";
      var friend3 = "David";
      var friend4 = "Mattias";

    </pre>

    <p> We could set each friend as a variable, but they would be individual and take a lot of code</p>
    <p>It make more sense to use an array which holds the information as a group: </p>
    <pre>
      var friends = ["Charlie", "Liz", "David", "Mattias"];
    </pre>
    <p>The [] denotes an array and each value is separated by a comma. Arrays are indexed, begining with zero.
    i.e. Charlie index 0, Liz index 1, David index 2, Matias index 3. The indices are used to retreive data in the array.</p>

    <pre>
      console.log(friends[0]) //"Charlie"
      friends[1] + " loves " + friends[2] // "Liz loves David"
    </pre>

    <p>We can also update the array values with the indices</p>
    <pre>
      friends[0]= "Chuck";
      friends[1] = "Lizzie";
    </pre>
    <p>And you can add new data by accessing an index that has no value</p>

    <pre>
      friends[4] = "Amelie";

    </pre>

<p> There are two more ways to initialize arrays</p>
<pre>
var friends = []; //by naming an empy array
var friends = new Array(); //(uncommon) function to make an array (A must be capital)
</pre>

<p>Arrays can hole any type of data</p>
<pre>
var randomCollection = [49, true, "Herminone", null];
</pre>
<p>Arrays have a length property (begining with 1, instead of index 0)</p>
<pre>
var nums = [45, 37, 89, 24];
nums.length    //4
</pre>
